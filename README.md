# ML-perceptron

## Student

Name: Stan Merlijn

Student nummer: 1863967

## Introduction
In this repo we are going to implement and test perceptrons, perceptron layers and a perceptron networks(neural network). Theset are going to be tested by creating AND, OR, INVERT, NAND, XOR and half adder logic gates. the reader can be found [here](https://canvas.hu.nl/courses/44675/assignments/343528)
